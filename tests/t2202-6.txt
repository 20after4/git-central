Subject: [cbas] topic branch updated. $new_commit_hash
X-Git-Refname: refs/heads/topic
X-Git-Reftype: branch
X-Git-Oldrev: $old_commit_hash
X-Git-Newrev: $new_commit_hash

The branch, topic has been updated
  discards $old_commit_abbrev create branch on topic 2
       via $new_commit_abbrev rewind and continue branch on topic

This update added new revisions after undoing existing revisions.  That is
to say, the old revision is not a strict subset of the new revision.  This
situation occurs when you --force push a change and generate a repository
containing something like this:

 * -- * -- B -- O -- O -- O ($old_commit_hash)
            \
             N -- N -- N ($new_commit_hash)

When this happens we assume that you've already had alert emails for all
of the O revisions, and so we here report only the revisions in the N
branch from the common base, B.

Those revisions listed above that are new to this repository have
not appeared on any other notification email; so we list those
revisions in full, below.
